# Employee Attrition Prediction â€“ Ipsha Gautam

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** in Python using **Scikit-learn** to predict employee attrition.  
The dataset used is the well-known **IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset** (1,470 employee records).  

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Preprocessed HR dataset: handled categorical encoding, normalization, and missing values.
- Built and compared models: Logistic Regression vs Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluated performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Visualized key feature importances to understand drivers of attrition.
